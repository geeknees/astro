Our first task on [REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/) is to introduce yourself. You may think that you cannot come up with anything worth writing about, but we disagree! The great thing about this topic is that you can write about anything and everything! Here are a few examples of responses from our users:

> My name is Masumi. I am studying English for programming. My goal is to be able to read and write English tech blogs with far less difficulty. I also want to learn phrases that are appropriate for every situation…

> I’m Yuta. I work for a company called Catal. I’ve been working at Catal for four years. I’m a manager of the marketing department. My job is to attract new customers through marketing. I also design websites…

> My name is Hiroshi. I am “a crazy angler” — an angler is a person who fishes with a rod and line. I am particular about what method to use to catching fish; I only use surface lures…

Our users write about their goals, dreams, hobbies, appearances, family… just about anything! Now, if you want to spice up your writing, think outside of the box, and try using these phrases for fun:

*   **One thing people may not know about me is…**
*   **Secretly, I like to…**
*   **People may be surprised to learn that…**
*   **I’ve never told anyone, but I’ve always wanted to…**

You know yourself best, so we want to hear as much information about you as we can. _Good luck!_
