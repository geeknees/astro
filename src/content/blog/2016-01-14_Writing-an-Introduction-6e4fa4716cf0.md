With any given essay in English, organization is an extremely important factor. Organization allows for your reader to understand your train of thought more clearly, and in a more logical way. Of course, an essay must grab the reader’s attention from the start with an introduction that sets up the rest of the composition nicely.

The following is an example of an introduction paragraph written by one of our Intermediate students. His response is based on the following topic:

> **_Describe a book you have read that is important to you. Explain why it is important. Give specific details and examples to explain your answer._**

> The book I have read that is important to me is “Norwegian Wood”. This is one of the most critically acclaimed books of Haruki Murakami. The story is based around two young people and their relationship as they grow up together.This book is so important to me that I have read this for four times or four times reading of this book has made it important. I have two emotional reasons why this book is important.

Let’s consider the overall picture; despite the few grammatical errors, the student has already started off his essay on a strong note. He has mentioned:

*   the title and author of the book
*   a brief explanation of the storyline
*   his personal connection to the book: “… I have read this for four times…”
*   and a transitional phrase to connect to his following body paragraphs: “I have two reasons…”

As the readers, **we now have a solid background of the student’s thoughts, and are prepared to hear about specific reasons why this book spoke to him so deeply.** We anticipate that he will talk more about what made him read the book so many times!

This is already a good start to an introduction. In the coming weeks, we will delve more deeply into writing first paragraphs that are even more convincing and enticing, as well as the art of _thesis writing_…
