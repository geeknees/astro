The structure of language determines the modes of thought is know as a theory called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. We Japanese can get a seasonal view because of having the traditional colors of Japan like Ai-iro ( indigo blue ), Sakura-iro ( pale rose ), Hi-iro ( scarlet ), and so on.

Some people might say a programming language is just a tool to create something. I agree with that, but I also think it will be at the core of one’s thoughts and products.
