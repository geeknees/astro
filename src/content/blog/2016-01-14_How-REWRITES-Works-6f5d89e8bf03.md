[REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/) provides a space for students of English to nurture their writing and thinking skills in a community-based online classroom.

Through the service, students from all over the world have the opportunity to receive feedback on their writing from both prestigious educators and valued peers. Then, students can interact with the online community by reading other entries, leaving comments, and taking away valuable writing tips.

**DEVELOP CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS**

There are many English students out there who are struggling to find a way to transfer their thoughts into written form — let alone in a foreign language. Writing in English caters greatly to the furthering of critical thinking skills, and allows students to support their points of view in a logically organized manner. Written exercises and topics provided on [REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/) will teach students about formulating essays of a highly academic level, preparing them for placement tests, school exams, and future employment opportunities.

**ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE EVALUATION**

While most students are accustomed to having their written work evaluated on technical errors (grammar, spelling, and the like), an enormous amount do not have the chance to receive feedback that emphasizes the importance of profound thinking and useful phrases. [REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/) links students with native English speakers who are able to give high-level, in-depth corrections and evaluations that promote writing and re-writing drafts. With this constant connection to an English educator, students can track their progress in all aspects of their writing abilities.

**SOCIAL INTERACTION**

[REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/) also includes a social component in which students can read the works of other users. With this online community, users have the freedom to refer to essays besides their own for inspiration and tips. It is inherent within the [REWRITES](https://www.rewrites.me/)service that students will find the motivation to write more by learning from their peers.
