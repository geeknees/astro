### Tech is not everything, Style is more important.

Technique is not everything, of course your first step is copying someone else, and learn how to ollie or flip board. But skateboarding is a self-expression. You need to know how to express yourself. Then people realize who you are.

### You fail when you’re scared.

Don’t scared when you get into stairs, or you will lose your balance. In worst case, you will be injured. Don’t think. Believe you can do it when you try. Then you can understand how does it works. You can’t get anything from scared.

### Don’t be a poser.

Real skaters know you are a real skater or a poser skater. Because real skaters know more things from their experience. They are checking the place of scratch of your board and shoes. Trying to be cool is not cool. so Don’t be a poser.
